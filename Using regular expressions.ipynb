      "      forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he was\n",
      "      the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy’s steward. Let me\n",
      "      recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit\n",
      "      confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy’s using him\n",
      "      ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always\n",
      "      been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated\n",
      "      Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the\n",
      "      particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the\n",
      "      least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham\n",
      "      mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not\n",
      "      well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he\n",
      "      was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the\n",
      "      way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing,\n",
      "      indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,\n",
      "      Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but\n",
      "      really, considering his descent, one could not expect much\n",
      "      better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      “His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the\n",
      "      same,” said Elizabeth angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him\n",
      "      of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward,\n",
      "      and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      “I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a\n",
      "      sneer. “Excuse my interference—it was kindly meant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      “Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much\n",
      "      mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as\n",
      "      this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the\n",
      "      malice of Mr. Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had\n",
      "      undertaken to make enquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane\n",
      "      met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such\n",
      "      happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was\n",
      "      satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth\n",
      "      instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for\n",
      "      Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else,\n",
      "      gave way before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for\n",
      "      happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "      “I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling\n",
      "      than her sister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But\n",
      "      perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any\n",
      "      third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      “No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\n",
      "      satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of\n",
      "      his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which\n",
      "      have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the\n",
      "      good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is\n",
      "      perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less\n",
      "      attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to\n",
      "      say by his account as well as his sister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no\n",
      "      means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very\n",
      "      imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s regard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      “Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?”\n",
      "\n",
      "      “No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      “This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\n",
      "      satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”\n",
      "\n",
      "      “He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has\n",
      "      heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it\n",
      "      was left to him _conditionally_ only.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      “I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth\n",
      "      warmly; “but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances\n",
      "      only. Mr. Bingley’s defense of his friend was a very able one, I\n",
      "      dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the\n",
      "      story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall\n",
      "      venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each,\n",

      "      scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told\n",

      "      does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de\n",
      "      Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these\n",

      "      introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment\n",
      "      to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should\n",

      "      replied thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "      “My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world\n",
      "      in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of\n",
      "      your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a\n",
      "      wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst\n",
      "      the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me\n",
      "      leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in\n",

      "      that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time\n",
      "      maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of\n",
      "      my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I\n",
      "      look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by\n",
      "      your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant\n",
      "      guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted\n",
      "      by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a\n",
      "      young lady like yourself.” And with a low bow he left her to\n",
      "      attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly\n",
      "      watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very\n",
      "      evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and\n",
      "      though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it\n",
      "      all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”\n",
      "      “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see\n",
      "      him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with\n",
      "      unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him\n",
      "      time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr.\n",
      "      Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and\n",
      "      Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length\n",
      "      of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a\n",
      "      slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to\n",
      "      Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "      “I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied\n",

      "      attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid\n",
      "      me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady\n",
      "      Catherine’s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a\n",

      "      observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as\n",
      "      Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the\n",
      "      felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she\n",
      "      felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to\n",
      "      like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly saw\n",
      "      were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near\n",
      "      her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper,\n",
      "      therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\n",

      "      freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane\n",

      "      subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while\n",
      "      enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a\n",
      "      charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from\n",
      "      them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was\n",
      "      such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane,\n",
      "      and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\n",
      "      she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her\n",
      "      younger daughters, as Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them\n",
      "      in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at\n",

      "      the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go\n",
      "      into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this\n",
      "      circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it\n",
      "      is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to\n",
      "      find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She\n",
      "      concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be\n",
      "      equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing\n",
      "      there was no chance of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "      In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her\n",
      "      mother’s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a\n",
      "      less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she\n",
      "      could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy,\n",
      "      who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being\n",

      "      At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady\n",

      "      long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over,\n",
      "      singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing\n",
      "      Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the\n",
      "      company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she\n",
      "      endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain;\n",
      "      Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting\n",
      "      was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth’s eyes\n",
      "      were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched\n",
      "      her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which\n",
      "      was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving,\n",
      "      amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she\n",

      "      fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner\n",
      "      affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see\n",
      "      how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.\n",
      "      She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of\n",
      "      derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\n",
      "      imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\n",
      "      interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the\n",
      "      hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,\n",

      "\n",
      "      “If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to\n",

      "      the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with\n",
      "      the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that\n",

      "      accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the\n",
      "      house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity\n",
      "      of showing it without her husband’s help. It was rather small,\n",

      "      arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave\n",
      "      Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten,\n",
      "      there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by\n",

      "      condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some\n",

      "      Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at\n",

      "      the bottom of the table, by her ladyship’s desire, and looked as\n",
      "      if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved,\n",
      "      and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was\n",
      "      commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now\n",
      "      enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a\n",
      "      manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But\n",
      "      Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration,\n",
      "      and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the\n",
      "      table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much\n",
      "      conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an\n",
      "      opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de\n",
      "      Bourgh—the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady\n",
      "      Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time.\n",
      "      Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss\n",
      "      de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing\n",
      "      she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,\n",
      "      and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\n",
      "\n",
      "      When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to\n",
      "      be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without\n",
      "      any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on\n",
      "      every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not\n",
      "      used to have her judgement controverted. She enquired into\n",
      "      Charlotte’s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a\n",

      "      hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her\n",
      "      poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great\n",
      "      lady’s attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of\n",
      "      dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs.\n",
      "      Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\n",
      "      Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she\n",
      "      knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very\n",

      "      Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered\n",
      "      them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed,\n",

      "      passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a\n",
      "      few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all\n",

      "      there, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\n",
      "      Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing\n",
      "      it. She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after\n",
      "      going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or\n",
      "      satin curtains.\n",
      "\n",
      "      Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine\n",

      "      idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt\n",
      "      than to run such a risk. But against this there were objections;\n",
      "      and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if\n",
      "      her private enquiries to the absence of the family were\n",
      "      unfavourably answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "      Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\n",
      "      whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name\n",
      "      of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family\n",

      "      herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and\n",
      "      she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper\n",

      "      Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance\n",
      "      of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length\n",
      "      they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\n",
      "\n",
      "      The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.\n",
      "      They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some\n",
      "      time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\n",
      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and\n",
      "      admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually\n",
      "      ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of\n",
      "      a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was\n",
      "      instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite\n",
      "      side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.\n",
      "      It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising\n",
      "      ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front,\n",
      "      a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but\n",
      "      without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal\n",
      "      nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen\n",
      "      a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty\n",
      "      had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\n",
      "      all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt\n",

      "\n",
      "      They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the\n",

      "      her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest\n",
      "      the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place,\n",
      "      they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited\n",
      "      for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she\n",
      "      was.\n",
      "\n",
      "      The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much\n",
      "      less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding\n",
      "      her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large,\n",
      "      well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after\n",
      "      slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.\n",
      "      The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving\n",
      "      increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.\n",
      "      Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the\n",
      "      whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the\n",
      "      winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with\n",
      "      delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were\n",
      "      taking different positions; but from every window there were\n",
      "      beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their\n",
      "      furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but\n",
      "      Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither\n",
      "      gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real\n",
      "      elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\n",
      "\n",
      "      “And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress!\n",

      "      by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate,\n",
      "      the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must\n",
      "      appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so\n",
      "      vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself\n",
      "      in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus come\n",
      "      a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes\n",
      "      sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his\n",
      "      discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment\n",
      "      arrived—that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She\n",

      "\n",
      "      They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water,\n",
      "      and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a\n",

      "      was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and,\n",
      "      though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her\n",
      "      uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as\n",

      "      thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House,\n",
      "      whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to\n",

      "      thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was\n",
      "      still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt\n",
      "      himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was\n",
      "      not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in\n",
      "      seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her\n",
      "      with composure.\n",
      "\n",
      "      At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence\n",
      "      of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more\n",
      "      like herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "      They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a\n",
      "      while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where\n",
      "      the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many\n",
      "      charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long\n",
      "      range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the\n",
      "      stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole\n",
      "      park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant\n",
      "      smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the\n",
      "      matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought\n",
      "      them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to\n",
      "      the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They\n",
      "      crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air\n",
      "      of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet\n",
      "      visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed\n",
      "      room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough\n",
      "      coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its\n",
      "      windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived\n",
      "      their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great\n",
      "      walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the\n",
      "      carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore,\n",
      "      obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on\n",
      "      the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but\n",
      "      their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to\n",
      "      indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much\n",
      "      engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in\n",
      "      the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced\n",
      "      but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were\n",
      "      again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was quite equal to\n",
      "      what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching\n",
      "      them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less\n",
      "      sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\n",
      "      they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more\n",
      "      prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and\n",
      "      to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a\n",
      "      few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into\n",
      "      some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk\n",
      "      concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was\n",
      "      immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost\n",
      "      none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she\n",
      "      began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she\n",
      "      had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when\n",
      "      some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise\n",
      "      of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her\n",
      "      colour changed, and she said no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "      Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing,\n",
      "      he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to\n",
      "      her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was\n",
      "      quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his\n",
      "      being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people\n",
      "      against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself.\n",
      "      “What will be his surprise,” thought she, “when he knows who they\n",
      "      are? He takes them now for people of fashion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named\n",
      "      their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to\n",
      "      see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his\n",
      "      decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.\n",
      "      That he was _surprised_ by the connection was evident; he\n",
      "      sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going\n",
      "      away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with\n",
      "      Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but\n",
      "      triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some\n",
      "      relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\n",
      "      attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\n",
      "      expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his\n",
      "      intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.\n",
      "\n",
      "      The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr.\n",
      "      Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as\n",
      "      often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood,\n",
      "      offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and\n",
      "      pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually\n",
      "      most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with\n",
      "      Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said\n",
      "      nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be\n",
      "      all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and\n",
      "      continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what\n",
      "      can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_—it cannot be for _my_ sake\n",
      "      that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could\n",
      "      not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should\n",
      "      still love me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the\n",
      "      two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending\n",
      "      to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some\n",
      "      curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It\n",
      "      originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the\n",
      "      morning, found Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and\n",
      "      consequently preferred her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by\n",
      "      her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence,\n",
      "      the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been\n",
      "      assured of his absence before she came to the place, and\n",
      "      accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very\n",
      "      unexpected—“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that\n",
      "      you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed,\n",
      "      before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not\n",
      "      immediately expected in the country.” He acknowledged the truth\n",
      "      of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned\n",
      "      his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with\n",
      "      whom he had been travelling. “They will join me early to-morrow,”\n",
      "      he continued, “and among them are some who will claim an\n",
      "      acquaintance with you—Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were\n",
      "      instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had\n",
      "      been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by\n",
      "      his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "      “There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after\n",
      "      a pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will\n",
      "      you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to\n",
      "      your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?”\n",
      "\n",
      "      The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too\n",
      "      great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She\n",
      "      immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of\n",
      "      being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and,\n",
      "      without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying\n",
      "      to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of\n",
      "      her.\n",
      "\n",
      "      They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.\n",
      "      Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was\n",
      "      flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her\n",
      "      was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the\n",
      "      others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "      Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "      He then asked her to walk into the house—but she declared herself\n",
      "      not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time\n",
      "      much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She\n",
      "      wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every\n",
      "      subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling,\n",
      "      and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.\n",
      "      Yet time and her aunt moved slowly—and her patience and her ideas\n",
      "      were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "      On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go\n",
      "      into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined,\n",
      "      and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy\n",
      "      handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off,\n",
      "      Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "      The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of\n",
      "      them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they\n",
      "      had expected. “He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and\n",
      "      unassuming,” said her uncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "      “There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,”\n",
      "      replied her aunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is not\n",
      "      unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some\n",
      "      people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      “I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was\n",
      "      more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no\n",
      "      necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was\n",
      "      very trifling.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      “To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as\n",
      "      Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his\n",
      "      features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he\n",
      "      was so disagreeable?”\n",
      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had\n",
      "      liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that\n",
      "      she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "      “But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,”\n",
      "      replied her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I\n",
      "      shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind\n",
      "      another day, and warn me off his grounds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his\n",
      "      character, but said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "      “From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I\n",
